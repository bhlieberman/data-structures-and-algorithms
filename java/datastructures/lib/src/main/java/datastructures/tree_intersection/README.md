# README

This class implements a hashmap-based methods to search two binary trees for their common elements.

## API

This class exposes a single method: `treeIntersection`. It returns a set of the keys common to both trees.

## Performance characteristics

This method of finding the intersection of two binary trees requires O(2n) space (for the hashmap and keySet) and O(2n) time for each traversal.
